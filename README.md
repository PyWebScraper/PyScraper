How to run:
PyScraper is written and tested in Python > 3.9.13.
Although it will probably run on older Python we recommend running on 3.9.13 or newer.

Steps to get PyScraper up and running:

Unzip to a suitable location on your computer.
Open a terminal in the unzipped folder
create a python virtual environment
> python3 -m venv venv
activate the virtual environment
> /venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
# or
> /venv/Scripts/activate.bat
If you are on unix systems

> source venv/bin/activate
install python decencies to the virtual environment
(venv) > pip3 install -r requirements.txt
